		<h2>My first entry</h2>
		<h6>Aug 15</h6>
			<h2>Why did I take this class?</h2>
			<p>I want to learn how to create video games, and I was really interested in coding.</p>
			<h2>What do I expect to get out of this class?</h2>
			<p>I wanna read programming langages easily, and create things with those languages.</p>

		<h2>UX vs. UI</h2>
		<h6>Aug. 24 2016</h6>
			<h3>Difference Between UX and UI</h3>
			<p>UX stands for user experience and focuses on how the user is experiencing a site.</p>
			<p>UI stands for user interface and focuses on what the user sees.</p>

			<h2>What I Thought of CSS</h2>
				<p>What I thought of CSS initially was, it was really confusing, and really difficult and I would take years to understand what I'm doing with it. </p>
		</div>
		<div id="fith">
			<h1>Digimon GO</h1>
			<p>I thought this assignment was difficult and irritating mainly due to images being in the wrong place, and trying to find out what was causing the problem. TL;DR I hated it lol</p>
		</div>
		<div id="frth" class="content">
			<h2>Responsive Web Design</h2>
				<p>What I think of it is, that it's really cool and convenient for mobile users but must be really irritating to implement.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="six">
			<h2>Media Queries</h2>
			<p>I thought it was a really cool thing that I could use for my websites.</p>
		</div>
		<div id=svn>
			<h2>Basic Javascript</h2>
			<p>At first I thought Java script was going to be very irritating and difficult, but as we got into it, turns out it was relatively easy.</p>
		</div>
		<div id=ayt>
			<h2>Conditionals</h2>
			<p>It was annoying. Not much else to say about it.</p>
		</div>
		<div id=nein>
			<h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
			<p>This was really easy compared to the black magic that is referred to as "CSS", and I didn't rip my hair out as much on this... so theres that too. </p>
		</div>

			<h2>Verizon App Challenge Review</h2>
			<p>The problems our app was meant to solve were first, the problem of finding the stats of players in our school. The other problem it was meant to solve was, parents not being able to go to their kid's games. It solves the first problem by allowing to view stats of a WHOLE team roster. It solves the other problem by allowing live streams of their kids games. I would improve my video by getting a mic so the audio isnt as messed up. We have no current features. I don't have anything else to add to the app. The challenges we faced was making the video due to our schedules, and availability and lack of having each others contact information. I would probably have chosen another group.</p>

			<h2>Final Reflection!</h2>
			<p>
				This semester I learned how to code in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I was fine with everything EXCEPT CSS, I hated CSS. Through out the year, I had a lot of fun.
